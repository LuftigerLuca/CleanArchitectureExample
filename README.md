# Clean Architecture Example

This project demonstrates the principles of **Clean Architecture** using **Kotlin**.
The goal is to create a modular, testable, and maintainable software structure where business logic is independent of frameworks and external systems.

## What is Clean Architecture?

**Clean Architecture** is a software design philosophy that emphasizes the separation of concerns and dependency direction.
The key rule is that **dependencies point inward** — meaning:

* The **domain layer** knows nothing about frameworks, databases, or web APIs.
* **Outer layers** (like web or persistence) implement interfaces defined by the inner layers.

This leads to systems that are **highly testable, extendable, and independent** of external technologies.

## Benefits

* **High Testability:** Business logic can be tested without involving databases, frameworks, or network layers.
* **Framework Independence:** You can replace frameworks, databases, or delivery mechanisms with minimal effort.
* **Maintainability:** Changes in one layer have minimal impact on others.
* **Clear Dependency Direction:** All dependencies flow from the outside inward, never the other way around.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a **reference implementation and learning resource** for applying Clean Architecture in Kotlin.
It can be used as a **template for new projects** or as a **guide** to understanding modular architecture in practice.

## Technologies

* **Language:** Kotlin
* **Build Tool:** Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
* **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture
* **Goal:** A modular, testable, and maintainable codebase
